  This repo provides some Vagrant/Puppet manifests that automatically install
  and configure a test environment for the EPICS Archiver Appliance. The
  environment consists of the following virtual machines:

    archappl0        (first archiver node)
    archappl1        (second archiver node)
    testioc          (IOC providing some PVs to archive)
    archiveviewer    (SLACs archive viewer application)
    loadbalancer

  Note that a third archiver node is configured but not brought up by default.
  This allows to test the behavior with nodes that have failed or are down for
  maintenance.

  Use the shortcut in the start menu (category "others") to run the archive
  viewer application.

Software requirements:

  Virtual Box
  Vagrant
  Git
  Puppet
  librarian-puppet

Run the following commands to bring up the virtual machines:

  > librarian-puppet install
  > vagrant up
