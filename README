  This repo provides some Vagrant/Puppet manifests that automatically install
  and configure a test environment for the EPICS Archiver Appliance. The
  environment consists of the following virtual machines:

    archappl0        (first archiver node)
    archappl1        (second archiver node)
    testioc          (IOC providing some PVs to archive)
    archiveviewer    (SLACs archive viewer application)
    loadbalancer

  Note that a third archiver node is configured but not brought up by default.
  This allows to test the behavior with nodes that have failed or are down for
  maintenance.

  Use the shortcut in the start menu (category "others") to run the archive
  viewer application.

  Username and password for all machines is "vagrant", "vagrant".

Software requirements:

  Virtual Box
  Vagrant
  Git
  Puppet
  librarian-puppet

Getting started:
  Run the following commands to bring up the virtual machines:

  > cd environments/production/
  > librarian-puppet install
  > cd ../../
  > vagrant up

  As soon as the VMs are running you can go ahead and start the testioc:

  > vagrant ssh testioc
  (testioc)$ sudo service softioc-phase1 start

  Then you can use the browser from the archiverviewer VM and add some test PVs (http://archappl0:17665/mgmt/):

  double-counter-1Hz
  double-counter-100Hz

  Archiving should start after a few minutes. Then you should be able to
  retrieve data with SLAC's ArchiverViewer (use the shortcut in the "Others"
  section of the application launcher). Create a new connection to the archiver
  using

  pbraw://archappl0:17668/retrieval

  for direct access to one of the nodes or

  pbraw://loadbalancer/retrieval

  to use the load balancer.

  Note for Windows users: Run

  > git config --global core.autocrlf false

  before checking out the Git repositories. Otherwise Git will convert Unix
  line breaks (LF) to CR+LF. This will break init scripts etc.!

Note on legacy versions:
  Old versions of the Archiver Appliance using CAJ <1.1.16 are subject to a bug
  that causes the Archiver Appliance not to connect to PVs. You might need to
  set EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=127.0.0.1 in /etc/default/archappl-mgmt and
  /etc/default/archappl-engine to work around this problem.
